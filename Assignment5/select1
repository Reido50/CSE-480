Write a query that can tell me the names of the artists with the largest tracks in the 
database. For each artist, get their largest track (in Bytes) and have the query return 
the top ten largest tracks sizes and their artist (make the artistâ€™s name in ALL CAPS). 
Be sure to use aliases to adjust the column names as UPPER_NAME and MEMORY_SIZE.


SELECT upper(Artist.Name) as 'UPPER_NAME', Track.Bytes as 'MEMORY_SIZE'
FROM 
Artist
LEFT OUTER JOIN
Album ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId
LEFT OUTER JOIN
Track ON Album.AlbumId = Track.AlbumId
WHERE Track.Bytes IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY UPPER_NAME
HAVING MEMORY_SIZE = max(MEMORY_SIZE)
ORDER BY MEMORY_SIZE DESC
LIMIT 10;
