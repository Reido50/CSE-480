Write a query that returns the Genres that I have purchased the most tracks of. 
I only care about genres that I’ve purchased at least 10 tracks of. Please ignore 
any tracks costing a dollar or more (they are primarily TV shows). Please output 
two columns, the name of the genre (“Genre_Name”) and the number of tracks purchased 
(“Number_Purchased”). You may order your rows however you like.

SELECT Genre.Name AS Genre_Name, count() as Number_Purchased
FROM InvoiceLine
  LEFT OUTER JOIN Track
  ON InvoiceLine.TrackId = Track.TrackId
  LEFT OUTER JOIN Genre 
  ON Track.GenreId = Genre.GenreId
WHERE Track.UnitPrice < 1
GROUP BY Track.GenreId
HAVING count() > 9
ORDER BY Number_Purchased DESC;
