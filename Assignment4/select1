Write a SQL query that tells me each student’s name, grade and major, ordered 
by name. The names of the tables are table_1 and table_2, you will need to do 
some exploratory queries to learn the database’s schema.

SELECT table_2.student_name AS name, table_2.grade, table_1.major
FROM table_2 LEFT OUTER JOIN table_1 ON msu_netid = netid
ORDER BY table_2.student_name;
