I want the name of the artist and tracks, for the tracks on album that have the 
same name as the artist. Order by track name.

SELECT ar.Name, tr.Name
FROM Artist as ar 
INNER JOIN 
Album as al
ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId and ar.Name = al.Title
INNER JOIN
Track as tr
ON al.AlbumID = tr.AlbumID
ORDER BY tr.Name
