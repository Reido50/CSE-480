My name is Jimmy Olsen and I’ve been tasked by the
Daily Planet to determine all the powers that the
various super heroes have. I need to output a list
of super heroes and their powers
(ordered by super hero name, then by the power’s name).
The database also includes the super heroes with no known powers,
and they should be in the list as well.

SELECT supers.name as Super, powers.name as Power FROM supers
LEFT OUTER JOIN powers
ON id = super_id
ORDER BY Super, Power;
